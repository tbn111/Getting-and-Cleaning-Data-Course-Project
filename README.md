# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The run_analysis.R script does the following:

1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. 

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The file tidydata.txt derives from run_analysis.R, and is the data set produced from the aforementioned step referenced earlier.  


CodeBook.md is a code book that describes the variables, data, and transformations that were performed to clean up the data.
